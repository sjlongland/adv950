This is a port of the Advantech driver to modern (>=3.19) kernels.   As such,
it should be noted that this driver comes with absolutely no warranty.

Furthermore, I have given no consideration to support for older kernels, nor
has this been thoroughly tested.  If it builds, consider yourself lucky.

I'll be adding further notes here as I get more things working.  Long term,
I'd like to see this code cleaned up and merged into the standard `8250`
serial driver from which it forked (a long time ago by the looks of things).

Building procedures, get your kernel sources prepared (`make menuconfig`,
followed by perhaps `make bzImage modules` or maybe `make modules_prepare`),
then in the kernel source tree, run:

```
$ make modules M=/path/to/adv950/driver
```

With luck, you should find a `adv950.ko` file in `/path/to/adv950/driver`.

Create the directory `/lib/modules/$( uname -r )/extra` and plop that `.ko`
file in it, then run `depmod -a`.  Fingers crossed, you should be able to
`modprobe` the driver and it should work.  I find the `udev` subsystem
autodetects the serial device and attempts to load the driver at boot.

The devices appear as `/dev/ttyAPx` device nodes, and `dmesg` looks like this:

3. Installation

3.1. Login as 'root' before executing the following instructions.

3.2. Uncompress the driver
   # tar zxvf adv950_vM_NN.tar.gz

3.3. Build the driver
   a. Build driver for 2.4 kernel
      # cd adv950_vM_NN/2.4
      # make
   b. Build driver for 2.6 kernel
      # cd adv950_vM_NN/2.6
      # make
   Note: 
      To compile the source code, you must install kernel development header file package,"gcc" and "make" command.
      In 2.4 kernel version, you should use "ln" command to make a link named "linux-2.4" in /usr/src/, it link to you kernel development header installed folder.

	
3.4. Install the driver module
   # make install
   to see whether ttyAP0~ttyAP7 exist in /dev/ folder, 
   if not,please execute the following command, 
   # make node

3.5. Test driver and get serial port type configuration
   # make test

3.6. If you want the Linux bring up module at each boot,
   please follow the steps showing below
   a. Build driver 
   b. For 2.4 kernel, add "insmod /YOURLOCATION/adv950_vM_NN/2.4/adv950.o" to
      to boot up shell script.
   c. For 2.6 kernel, add "insmod /YOURLOCATION/adv950_vM_NN/2.6/adv950.ko" to
      to boot up shell script.  
   Fedora core 6 for example:
   add "insmod /YOURLOCATION/adv950_vM_NN/2.6/adv950.ko" to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

3.7. Uninstall the driver module and clean
   # make uninstall
   # make clean
